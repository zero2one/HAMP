# Mkcert

mkcert is a simple tool for making locally-trusted development certificates. It
requires no configuration.

Install the command line tool using Homebrew:

```shell
brew install mkcert
brew install nss # if you use Firefox
```

Create a local Certification Authority:

```shell
mkcert -install
```

This will:

* Created a new local CA üí•
* The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! ‚ö°Ô∏è
* The local CA is now installed in the Firefox trust store (requires browser
  restart)! ü¶ä

## Usage

This project has created a certifications directory for you, see the
`certifications` directory. Open a terminal window in that directory to create
new certificates:

```shell
cd /Volumes/webdev/www/_apache/certificates
```

Create new certificate for local.example.com:

```shell
mkcert local.example.com
```
